# visual shell

built on node and react

# Dependencies
- path, fs, child_process
# TODO
- set global variables (e.g., pwd)
    - do these have to be all the global variables, like for any shell emulator?
## UI
- should be able to have a view with full history (like a regular shell)
# Issues
- how to ensure security if it grows as an ecosytem?
